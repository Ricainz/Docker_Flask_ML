# Data Engineering Project

## Sentiment analyzer website

### Made by Radu Cernaianu and Cl√©ment Lambling

## Model

We built our model using the Amazon reviews for sentiment analysis dataset, check it out at https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews.

After some testing and comparing we went with a random forest model.

We built a basic web interface where the user can enter the word or sentence needed to be analysed. The result will be neutral, positive or negative.
